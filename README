zf-pastebin is a PHP pastebin which uses the Zend Framework (http://framework.zend.com) and the GeSHi - Generic Syntax Highlighter (http://qbnz.com/highlighter/)

Requirements:
* PHP 5.2.4 (built with sqlite) or later

Recommended:
* Apache 2.2.14 or later
* PHP 5.2.11 (built with sqlite 3.6.19) or later

Installation:
* Extract zf-pastebin
* Download the Zend Framework and GeSHi libraries from: http://framework.zend.com and http://qbnz.com/highlighter/
* In the library folder extract the Zend Framework and GeSHi libraries so it should look like:
	library/Zend
	library/geshi
	library/geshi.php
* Make sure that the application/data folder is writeable by the web server
* Browse to the zf-pastebin/public folder (tip: with the Zend Framework all other folders except for the public folder should be placed outside of your public web folder e.g. public_html/httpdocs changing the path within the public/index.php to match its private location)

Resetting the sqlite database:
$ cd application
$ rm -Rf data/
$ mkdir -p data/db; chmod -R a+rwX data
$ php scripts/load.sqlite.php --withdata #Remove --withdata if you do not need the test data
